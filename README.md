# UnArmMeIfYouDare
First rect-native Android Application

Using react native I built a React-Native application using 3rd party modules such as BackgroundTimer, Sound, TimeFormatter for Android.
The app is based around a timer.  The application can displays a cartoon bomb.  While the timer runs, it Play ticking sound to signify its running.  The bomb blows up after a random  number of generated seconds - unless the user presses a button on the screen - when they press the button they diffuse the bomb.  The users get points according to how close they are to the random counter the more points they get, if the bomb blows before they press the button they get no points.  They can replay as many times as they like, with the random counter to something different each time.  When they quit the game, a toast message displays their points.
